 * @section modules Modules
 *
 *  Remote Command Message - message based remote function execution
 *
 *  The Remote Command Message (RCM) package provides a client/server
 *  implementation for executing functions on a remote processor. The
 *  package contains the following modules.
 *     - @ref ti_rcm_RcmClient "RcmClient" - Client Module
 *     - @ref ti_rcm_RcmServer "RcmServer" - Server Module
 *
 *  This package provides modules for a client/server based implementation
 *  for executing functions on a remote processor. The IPC layer is based
 *  on messages. The application uses the RcmClient module to allocate a
 *  message, specify the remote function and its arguments, and then send
 *  the message to the server for execution. When the message returns, it
 *  contains the remote function's return values. The server is typically
 *  on a remote processor, but local server instances (on the same processor
 *  as the client) are also supported.
 *
 *  The following image provides an overview of a typical use case. An
 *  application running on the local cpu creates an RcmClient instance.
 *  Using the RcmClient instance handle, the application has access to all
 *  the necessary operations for executing a message on the remote server.
 *  The application must fill in the message with the remote function
 *  index, as supplied by the server, and the context needed by the remote
 *  function to execute. For higher level operations such as RPC, see the
 *  <tt>link ti.rpc.gen</tt> package which provides support for generating
 *  the stub and skeleton functions.
 *
 *  @image html ti/rcm/doc-files/Overview.png "Diagram 1: RCM Overview"
 *
 *  The RcmClient module is used to create instance objects. Each instance
 *  can send messages only to the server specified at create time. You
 *  create an instance for each server you want to send messages to. At
 *  create time the heap must be specified. The heap is used by the instance
 *  for allocating messages.
 *
 *  There are four types of execute commands:
 *  - synchronous blocking
 *  - synchronous non-blocking
 *  - synchronous deferred
 *  - asynchronous non-blocking
 *
 *  Here is an overview of the exec commands. See the
 *  @ref ti_rcm_RcmClient "RcmClient" module for more details on each
 *  function.
 *
 *  - RcmClient_exec() - synchronous blocking
 *    This function sends a message to the server and waits for the server
 *    to execute the message and to send the return message back to the
 *    client.
 *
 *  - RcmClient_execNoWait() - synchronous non-blocking
 *    This function sends a message to the server but does not wait for the
 *    return message. Control returns to the caller as soon as the message
 *    has been delivered to the underlying transport. The server will
 *    execute the message and send the return message back to the client
 *    where it is placed in a mailbox. The client collects the return message
 *    with a call to RcmClient_waitUntilDone() which is a blocking call.
 *    This is useful when the client has more work to do while the remote
 *    function is executing. It is also efficient because it does not require
 *    a local callback thread.
 *
 *  - RcmClient_execDpc() - synchronous deferred
 *    This function sends a message to the server and waits for the return
 *    message. When the server receives the message, it does not immediately
 *    execute it. Instead, it copies the message context into a local buffer
 *    and sends the message back to the client. Only after the message has
 *    been sent to the client, does the server execute the function. This is
 *    useful for server shutdown. This allows the client to regain ownership
 *    of the message and to return it to the heap and allows the server to
 *    shutdown without owning any resources allocated by the client.
 *
 *  - RcmClient_execAsync() - asynchronous non-blocking
 *    This function sends a message to the server but does not wait for the
 *    return message. Control returns to the caller as in the synchronous
 *    non-blocking case above. The server will execute the message and send
 *    the return message back to the client for delivery to a callback
 *    thread. When the return message arrives, the callback thread will
 *    invoke an application callback to notify the application that the
 *    return message has arrived. This is the only asynchronous part of the
 *    sequence as the application will be preempted by the callback thread.
 *    It is the application's responsibility to periodically monitor a flag
 *    (set by the callback) to complete the message delivery.
 *
